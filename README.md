# PUBMED SkimLit Model

## Overview
This repository contains code for a text classification model designed to categorize text from PUBMED articles into individual categories, making it easier to read and navigate through the content.

In this project we are going to be making 3 model for comparison. The base architecture used for this project is Multinomial Naive Bayes & Final is  based on the research done by Franck Dernoncourt and Ji Young Lee. 
The paper is available here: [(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.06071.pdf)]

The Final model architecture we are going to keep is found here : [(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05251.pdf)]

## Features
